FQAS 2009 was preceded by the 1994, 1996 and 1998 editions held in Roskilde, Denmark, the FQAS 2000 held in Warsaw, Poland, the 2002 held in Copenhagen, Denmark, and the 2004 and 2006 editions held in Lyon, France, and in Milan, Italy, respectively. FQAS is the premier conference concerned with the very important issue of providing users of information systems with ?exible querying capabilities, and withaneasyandintuitiveaccesstoinformation.Themainobjectiveistoachieve more expressive, informative, cooperative, and productive systems which faci- tate retrieval from information repositories such as databases, libraries, hete- geneous archives and the World-Wide Web. In targeting this objective, the c- ference draws on several research areas, such as information retrieval, database management, information ?ltering, knowledge representation, soft computing, management of multimedia information, and human–computer interaction. The conference provides a unique opportunity for researchers, developers and pr- titioners to explore new ideas and approaches in a multidisciplinary forum. The overalltopic of the FQAS conferences is innovative query systems aimed at providing easy, ?exible and human-friendly access to information. Such s- tems arebecoming increasinglyimportantalsodue to the huge andalwaysgr- ing number of users as well as the growing amount of available information.",

Power Query, part of the Microsoft Power BI suite, is a tool that automates the process of getting data into Excel and will save you hours of dull, repetitive, and error-prone work! Power Query makes it easy to extract data from many different data sources, filter that data, aggregate it, clean it and perform calculations on it, finally loading that data into either your worksheet or directly into the new Excel 2013 Data Model used by Power Pivot. This concise, practical book provides a complete guide to Power Query and how to use it to solve all of your Excel data-loading problems. Power Query for Power BI and Excel goes well beyond the surface of what Power Query can do. The book goes deep into the underlying M language, showing you how to do amazing things that aren’t going to be possible from just the GUI interface that is covered in most other books. You’ll have full command of the GUI, and you’ll be able to drop into the M language to go beyond what the GUI provides. The depth in this book makes it a must-have item for anyone who is pushing Power BI and Excel to their limits in the pursuit of business intelligence from data analysis. Teaches the basics of using Power Query to load data into Excel Helps you solve common, data-related problems with Power Query Shows how to write your own solutions in the powerful M language",

      "descricao": "There are millions of searchable data sources on the Web and to a large extent their contents can only be reached through their own query interfaces. There is an enormous interest in making the data in these sources easily accessible. There are primarily two general approaches to achieve this objective. The first is to surface the contents of these sources from the deep Web and add the contents to the index of regular search engines. The second is to integrate the searching capabilities of these sources and support integrated access to them. In this book, we introduce the state-of-the-art techniques for extracting, understanding, and integrating the query interfaces of deep Web data sources. These techniques are critical for producing an integrated query interface for each domain. The interface serves as the mediator for searching all data sources in the concerned domain. While query interface integration is only relevant for the deep Web integration approach, the extraction and understanding of query interfaces are critical for both deep Web exploration approaches. This book aims to provide in-depth and comprehensive coverage of the key technologies needed to create high quality integrated query interfaces automatically. The following technical issues are discussed in detail in this book: query interface modeling, query interface extraction, query interface clustering, query interface matching, query interface attribute integration, and query interface integration.

      "autor": "José Amado",
      "descricao": "The motivation for computer forensics research includes the increase in crimes that involve the use of computers, the increasing capacity of digital storage media, a shortage of trained computer forensics technicians, and a lack of computer forensics standard practices. The hypothesis of this dissertation is that domain modeling of the computer forensics case environment can serve as a methodology for selecting keyword search terms and planning forensics examinations. This methodology can increase the quality of forensics examinations without significantly increasing the combined effort of planning and executing keyword searches. The contributions of this dissertation include:? A computer forensics examination planning method that utilizes the analytical strengths and knowledge sharing abilities of domain modeling in artificial intelligence and software engineering,? A computer forensics examination planning method that provides investigators and analysts with a tool for deriving keyword search terms from a case domain model, and? The design and execution of experiments that illustrate the utility of the case domain modeling method. Three experiment trials were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of case domain modeling, and each experiment trial used a distinct computer forensics case scenario: an identity theft case, a burglary and money laundering case, and a threatening email case. Analysis of the experiments supports the hypothesis that case domain modeling results in more evidence found during an examination with more effective keyword searching. Additionally, experimental data indicates that case domain modeling is most useful when the evidence disk has a relatively high occurrence of text-based documents and when vivid case background details are available. A pilot study and a case study were also performed to evaluate the utility of case domain modeling for typical law enforcement investigators. In these studies the subjects used case domain models i.",

You’ll learn how to integrate SEO and PPC in campaigns that engage more consumers than ever before and use data from both to improve the performance of each. Next, How to Make SEO Work for You completely demystifies SEO, showing you how to grab value from “low hanging fruit” and start optimizing everything from pages, text, and keywords to images–even your page’s underlying HTML code. Mitchell shows how to craft a strategy that reflects your specific goals for attracting qualified traffic; measure everything from the quality of visitor engagement to sales conversions; structure sites that are friendlier to both searchers and search engines; earn the honest links that search algorithms love; and much more. Finally, in Unleash the Power of Paid Search, Mitchell brings together the processes, knowledge, and tools you need to build and manage exceptionally successful paid search campaigns. Mitchell guides you through the entire process of building and executing a winning campaign: defining goals and objectives, selecting keywords and match types, structuring accounts, scoring quality, managing ad copy, optimizing landing pages, monitoring, reporting, and more.

This invaluable guide provides step-by-step instructions for investigating Internet crimes, including locating, interpreting, understanding, collecting, and documenting online electronic evidence to benefit investigations. Cybercrime is the fastest growing area of crime as more criminals seek to exploit the speed, convenience and anonymity that the Internet provides to commit a diverse range of criminal activities. Today's online crime includes attacks against computer data and systems, identity theft, distribution of child pornography, penetration of online financial services, using social networks to commit crimes, and the deployment of viruses, botnets, and email scams such as phishing. Symantec's 2012 Norton Cybercrime Report stated that the world spent an estimated $110 billion to combat cybercrime, an average of nearly $200 per victim. Law enforcement agencies and corporate security officers around the world with the responsibility for enforcing, investigating and prosecuting cybercrime are overwhelmed, not only by the sheer number of crimes being committed but by a lack of adequate training material. This book provides that fundamental knowledge, including how to properly collect and document online evidence, trace IP addresses, and work undercover.
